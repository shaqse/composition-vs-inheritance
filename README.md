# composition-vs-inheritance

🤯 𝟭𝟬 𝗣𝗵𝗲𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗮𝘃𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲

1. 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Composition allows for easier combining and altering of behaviours without affecting other parts of the system.

2. 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Composition reduces component dependency, making systems more maintainable.

3. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: While many languages only support inheriting from one class, composition lets an object combine multiple components.

4. 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀: Composition often leads to clearer HAS-A relationships (e.g., a 𝙲𝚊𝚛 has an 𝙴𝚗𝚐𝚒𝚗𝚎) as opposed to the IS-A relationships of Inheritance.

5. 𝗥𝗲𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Objects can be reused in various contexts without creating subclass hierarchies.

6. 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱𝘀 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: Changes in a base class might unintentionally affect subclasses. Composition mitigates this issue.

7. 𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿: Composition allows changing of operations at runtime by switching out components.

8. 𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘀𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Composition can better hide the internal details of components.

9. 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Overusing Inheritance can cloud code's origin and purpose. Composition tends to be more explicit.

10. 𝗙𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀: Composition reduces unexpected behaviours by containing them within distinct objects.

While Inheritance models "IS-A" relationships, Composition's 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆, and 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 often make it a more suitable choice for modelling "HAS-A" relationships.
